**What is Rio?**
Rio is a framework written in AS3, targeted for developing rapid and stable gui components. It is light weight, has a minimal memory footprint and written without any dependecy of a external library, so it works great in any flash publishing platform, such as Flash/Flex-builder, FDT, FlashDevelop and the Flash EDI. 

The framework itself has a few off the shelf ready components but the main goal with the framework is to extend the abstract classes and make you own components.
